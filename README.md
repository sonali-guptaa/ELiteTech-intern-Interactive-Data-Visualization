# Interactive Data Visualization

This project involves creating an interactive data visualization using Python libraries such as **Plotly**. The goal is to create a dashboard that visualizes various metrics (e.g., GDP per Capita, Life Expectancy, etc.) of countries and their growth over a period of time.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: 
  Build an interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze metrics related to countries' development over time.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - GDP per Capita
  - Life Expectancy
  - Population Growth
  - Other socio-economic indicators

## Key Steps

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Use publicly available datasets such as those from the World Bank or Kaggle.
   - Ensure the dataset includes time-series data for metrics like GDP, life expectancy, etc.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Normalize and clean the data.
   - Ensure the data is in a format suitable for visualization.

3. **Interactive Dashboard Development**:
   - Use **Plotly Dash** or **Bokeh** to create an interactive dashboard.
   - Include features like:
     - Dropdown menus for selecting countries or metrics.
     - Time sliders for analyzing growth over time.
     - Tooltips for detailed information on data points.

4. **Visualization Features**:
   - Line charts for time-series data.
   - Scatter plots to compare metrics like GDP vs. Life Expectancy.
   - Bar charts for country-wise comparisons.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly
